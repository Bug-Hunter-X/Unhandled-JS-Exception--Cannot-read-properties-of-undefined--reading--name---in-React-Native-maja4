This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or when components render before data has fully loaded.  For example, imagine you have a component that displays user data fetched from an API.  If the API request hasn't completed, the `userData` object will be null, and attempting to access `userData.name` will throw this error.
